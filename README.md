# Twilio Connektion

A Twilio Voice app that connects you to someone new.


## Summary

Twilio Connektion is a Twilio Voice app that lets conference goers connect to
people they have not yet met.  Using a "chat roulette" style random pool, Twilio
Connektion creates a central number that people can call and creates new users
for people who want to "connekt."  

Folks who call that number go through a very quick voice registration and then
are connected to someone they haven't spoke with before at random.

Callers' phone numbers or other identifying information are never revealed - it
is up to the participants to choose whether or not to make a personal
connection.
